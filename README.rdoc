Five Easy Payments is a Rails app that calculates a user's Venmo "credit score" and visually informs him/her of their peer payment statistics. Venmo is a tool used to pay and charge friends for anything from a sandwich to this month's rent. Five Easy Payments graphically informs a user's peers how likely and how quickly he/she is to repay a charge based on the user's payment history.
